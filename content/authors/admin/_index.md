Hey! I am currently working as a Research Assistant under Prof. Madhava Krishna in Robotics Research Center. My current research statement includes making robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in a featureless environment and improving correspondence matching in high illumination and viewpoint variations. We have developed deep learning-based counterparts of the classical SLAM components to tackle these problems.


<!-- I was introduced to robotics during a year-long research internship at IIIT, (Hyderabad, India 2017-2018), where I worked on Multi-Robot SLAM and view-invariant recognition for place recognition and relocalisation. -->
