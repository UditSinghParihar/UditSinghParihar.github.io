Hey! I have done my master's from IIITH from Robotics Research Centre where I have been working on the intersection of SLAM, 3D computer vision, and deep learning.
Our work on robust pose graph SLAM has been published at the ICRA conference and our work on Robust feature matching has been presented at the IROS conference. These works targets improving SLAM performance in feature-less regions and improving correspondence matching in high illumination and viewpoint variations.

At OLA Electric, I have been working on 3D scene representation of end-to-end autonomous driving agents and self-supervised depth estimation. On the development side of things, I have been involved in porting the PyTorch model to the TensorRT model for faster inference on resource-constraint devices. Developing ROS2 wrapper around the deep learning pipeline.
