Hey! I am currently working as a Research Assistant under Prof. Madhava Krishna in Robotics Research Center. My current research statement includes making robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in a featureless environment and improving correspondence matching in high illumination and viewpoint changes. We tackle these problems by incorporating classical computer vision in deep learning pipelines.
