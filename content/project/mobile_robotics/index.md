Implemented following functionality in the robotic toolbox:   

1. `Project 1`: Lidar-Camera Calibration, DLT, Zhang's Method, Homography estimation and decomposition into `K, R and T`.  
2. `Project 2`: Epipolar lines and Epipoles calculation. Visual odometry calculation using essential matrix decomposition into `R & T` under RANSAC scheme.   
3. `Project 3`: Stereo reconstruction, Disparity Calculation, `R|T` estimation using PnP and implementation of Gauss Newton from scratch.  
4. `Project 4`: Motion model, observation model and pose estimation using EKF.  
5. `Project 5`: Trajectory planning using polynomials functions, Bernstein polynomials and obstacle avoidance.
